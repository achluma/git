git-replay(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-replay - EXPERIMENTAL: Replay commits on a new base, works with bare repos too


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
(EXPERIMENTAL!) 'git replay' --onto <newbase> <oldbase> <branch>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Takes a range of commits, specified by <oldbase> and <branch>, and
replays them onto a new location (see `--onto` option below).

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

OPTIONS
-------

--onto <newbase>::
	Starting point at which to create the new commits.  May be any
	valid commit, and not just an existing branch name.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

For a successful, non-conflicted replay, the exit status is 0.  When
the replay has conflicts, the exit status is 1.  If the replay is not
able to complete (or start) due to some kind of error, the exit status
is something other than 0 or 1.
